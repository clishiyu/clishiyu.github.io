During my exchange year at the University of Chicago, I started a mailing list to document my year. This was ideal as I had a lot to say this year, I am also famously bad at keeping up with my friends, and more modern social media platforms are genuinely a plague on my mind. It was never that serious, but in the end I am quite happy with how it turned out. 

I have been considering for a long time now how to best preserve this -- a Substack seemed too presumptuous. This is the next best thing and allows me to practice coding at the same time. I wonder too what will be the future of it. I have made lists of people I would like to add to the mailing list: season 2, yet I've not gotten around to any of it, and instead spend my days drooling away... 

Now after an incredibly difficult year, and a busy month of travelling, I find myself finally getting around to this project. A big thank you to all my friends, old and new. Hello from Germany.

And as always -- 
cheers,
Coco
