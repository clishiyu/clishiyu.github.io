Hello,

Today I went climbing with some high school friends. The guy working at the front desk was someone from Elgin, and I saw some other fellow Elginers later on (Nathan R, Kohen, and Alex). It was a funny moment when I told Kevin that there's someone that looks exactly like Nathan at the gym, at which point he told me that it is, in fact, Nathan. The other day, I also came across Preet at the gym, although she didn't seem too enthusiastic to chat.

It's a nice feeling to come home to a community, despite all its flaws. It seems that this winter break many have decided that they have had enough of exploring the world and are all back for substantial amounts of time, although maybe it's because this is just what I'm doing. 

It's interesting to find out where people are now, and being back home is also refreshingly normal in that there are not sweats absolutely everywhere. It's the most normal cross-section of people in all the communities that I am a part of, no offense. A decent chunk of people seem like they have it figured out, it's a joy to hear what cool things people are pursuing. Some of these people were real buffoons in high school and I still would not trust them to be my doctor in the future. 

An equal number of people are taking their time and just doing whatever, but I think because people have known each other for so long, the friendships and history that we share with each other is way more important.

It's nice to be back. Crazy how investing in your communities gives you something in return. Who would've thought! Almost convincing enough for me to stay in one place for a long time.

Cheers,
Coco
