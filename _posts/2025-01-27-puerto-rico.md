Hey all

I'm in Puerto Rico for the weekend and it's been going well. We got a $500 parking fine within an hour of arriving and then successfully got out of the $500 parking fine 24 hours later. There's been a substantial amount of nature and exploring but perhaps more would be appreciated. The food has been just fine but the weather has been hot. 

Not being in Chicago always reminds me of how specific and difficult it is to be in Chicago! I am now massively much more behind in my work as well. It shall never end.

As Kiana always says... I feel that I am at war with time or something. There are wolves inside me, that's for sure.

Cheers,
Coco
