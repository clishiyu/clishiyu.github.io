Hyde Park Produce is imminently closing down. I've known this for a while now, but I haven't written about it yet. I stopped going there initially because they stopped taking cards and only took cash. I thought it was a temporary thing, but then it was clear by the third time or so that it wasn't going to change. 

So I started going to Trader Joe's instead. Which is slightly farther, and I am lazy, so I find myself grocery shopping less and less. Also, I have a bit of a grudge against Trader Joe's. I tried to buy chocolate in there and I was so overwhelmed by the amount of options, none of them seemed particularly yummier than another. Ece said she had the same thing where she meant to buy cereal but didn't due to decision paralysis. I digress.

One time, I noticed that the cashier was someone I know from Hyde Park Produce. i asked him why he's at Trader Joe's instead, and he told me that Hyde Park Produce stopped paying him, and when he asked about his money, they fired him. Well, ok. That's that I guess. I also remember Omri has been telling me for a while now that the quality of their produce has gone down, but surely that's on him for not choosing good apples. 

Where else can I get a single sprig of basil? Or just like, normal cereal and normal peanut butter? I used to buy $50 gift cards because you get 10% off with that. Tarragon â€” I don't think Trader Joe's has that, or Amish butter. To be fair, the main thing is that it's just slightly closer to home. It hasn't even shut yet, so I'm emoting for nothing, really.

On another note, I went to Target instead to buy some fruit because I was close by and it is closer to home than Trader Joe's. I thought to write this email because this apple is completely rotten days after purchasing it. 


P.S. Script from a friend. I had to include because I think you guys should see. God bless America.
