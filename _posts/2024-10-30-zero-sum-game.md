hi guys!

today has been really good so far. i went to the gym at 8am then got my vaccine at 9am. then i went grocery shopping and cooked until my class. i actually understood what was going on in the class because i spent like 5 hours yesterday reading the textbook and trying to do the problems. what i did not realize was the material i needed to do the problems were not yet taught so i basically taught myself some of it and as a result actually followed what was going on during lectures.

lectures was also an ok experience because i sat beside some people i know. after class i had lunch with theo from edinburgh (who is not ginger and nothing like theo from king's college london), and then we grabbed $1 milkshakes which is a thing on wednesday. i am now doing my thermal problems in the lab office, and its going swimmingly for once because we were basically given the answers during class.

however, do not let this fool you. the subject line exists for a reason. the unfortunate thing is that i seemed to have acquired an ailment of sorts -- really bad headache, sore everywhere, and bad temperature regulation. This is really not the time to get sick so i'll drink my water and lemsip even, as a little treat.

But such is my life! At a certain point maybe it is actually enjoyable to do so much physics... Is this stockholm syndrome?

I am looking at flights from london to chicago, as I have booked a flight for chicago to london. It is outrageously expensive so i'll keep you updated on how this motive will happen. Unfortunate really, because airline companies know that is when thanksgiving break ends in the US. They know everything!

Cheers and as always, I hope you are well.
