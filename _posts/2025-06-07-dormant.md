I've been on vacation and the brain is so dormant all it knows is to doomscroll.

My grades came out and they were very good.

I have lots of business to attend to (one of my boxes got returned to sender. Maybe there's more).

But otherwise I am spending lots of time with my parents and forgetting how to interact with people my own age.

Cheers,
Coco
