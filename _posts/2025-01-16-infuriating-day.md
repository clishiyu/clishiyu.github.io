This evening I went to a discussion session which was from 6:30-7:50pm?! My class before that ended at 4:30 so it was unbelievably awkward timing already. The discussion session was absolutely useless. 

Then I went home and cooked, which took more than an hour, and I used enough cookware to basically fill up an entire dishwasher. I made pumpkin soup with tarragon, italian sausage, spinach, parsley, mushrooms. That sounds really yummy, and it did turn out pretty good, but judgements are completed clouded by the effort required.

And now it is 10:30pm and I have to do work. I don't know guys, this is not optimal. I blame it all on my bike being broken thus it taking twice the amount of both time and effort to get around. 

Angry cheers,
Coco
