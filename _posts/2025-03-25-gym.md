i went to the gym for the first time in months and i feel amazing! i feel powerful and awesome and not sleepy. wow!

new quarter has started and i may be enrolling myself in 4 classes 2 of which are grad physics classes. "coco! haven't you learned from your mistakes?!" no. i haven't. and i'll live to tell the tale. i want to do a deep dive on these classes so i'll write a whole thing on this when i can bother to do it.

on the other hand... to all my king's enjoyers... i hope you have lots of fun in your last week of teaching. it's truly a time to be in this economy with the trying times. yes. 

attached is my exchange with someone who is maybe interested in renting my flat but equally may be a scammer. not sure.

cheers,
coco
