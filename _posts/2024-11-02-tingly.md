I have this little poster on my wall in my room from museum tinguely in basel. i got it when i went to basel with theo.

Last night friends noah and leti were in my room to grab the excess tomato soup and they saw that poster and it turns out they both know the guy - tinguely. Leti had been to the museum before because she has visited a friend in basel as well; whereas noah just knows the guys work and really likes it (he is a physics and art major.)

It was a kind of jigsaw falling into place feeling to have this extremely specific shared experience.

On the other hand this morning i was supposed to go get my machine shop training and i totally forgot about it and now i have to reschedule and i feel really bad. Note to self to set notifications for calendar events.

I finished a scarf I started in June... It may be the ugliest thing ever but its so camp that i actually love it.

Hope this week will be swell for you! I have crazy deadlines towards the end of the week but that means i will inevitably slack off towards the start of the week hehe.

Cheers,
Coco
