hello all!

i find myself in the newest of yorks and feeling like the newest of me. you
know what they say-- new york, new me!

big cities are inherently rejuvenating and friends are such beautiful things!!

chicago puts me in a constant state of stress and it is so refreshing to not
be there! i can breathe again.

however i am in the libraries still as the big midterms TM are coming up.

rejoice!

cheers,
coco
