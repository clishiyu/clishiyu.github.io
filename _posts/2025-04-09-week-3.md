Hey all,

Currently starting drama in my research group by telling on Emma that she was being mean to me. Not sure if this is the most pragmatic decision. I also hate confrontations. Also I'm only here for another two months so what does it matter anyways? Well, I've told the other Coco, and I'm going to talk to Greg. How is this stuff suppose to work? Is this even sensical?

Currently, as of like 8 hours now, I've been doing a pset. It's that kind of life again. Except that I will be done before the eve so I will go take time off and go to the gym. Maybe the questions are kind of working out so it is not like a completely horrible experience.

This morning I sat with Omri's flatmate David for about 3 hours while he did the psets and I just sat there quietly and watched... He explained to me everything that he did, but it's one of those situations where there is such a huge discrepancy between our abilities, that even when he explains it to me it still sounds like gibberish. To be fair, I know how to come up with the answers now, even if it means I'm just going through the "mathematical" motions. In my defense, the questions are borderline impossible, as per the TA's note below:

I'm determined to not spent 200,000 hours on a pset as I did last week. Not sustainable nor productive at that point. We'll see if this actually works.

Javi's case got dismissed! This man has no criminal record! He said it was a close call and will bring me the full updates soon. His visa is still revoked though. He had to take Greyhound buses from Chicago to go to New Orleans.

I may go to New Orleans at the end of week 6.

Other than that, I have one or two more questions to write down from the pset, after which it's dinner then gym time...

Cheers,
Coco
