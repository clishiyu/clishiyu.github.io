Hello all!

Maybe it is the appropriate time to send an update. I am finally doing by bachelor's thesis, and I feel quite proud of the progress I've made in like, the past week. However, on the grand scheme of the many months of supposed to have been doing my thesis, the progress is not very happy. 

I'm also not getting along with my supervising phd student very well, and thus seeking assistance from another phd student (whose name happens to also be coco li). However, things remain unresolved. It's really disappointing because I feel as though I've always been able to navigate group dynamics, at least adequately in situations when I need to. It really makes me feel stupid because 1. I don't need to be my "true self", 2. It's really important to be able to navigate this well... I fear that I am not explaining myself clearly and there is an obvious alternative for how to word this. Alas, this is my mailing list so you must read whatever trash I write (endearingly).

Anyways, here's some graphs I made (completely using someone else's Python package) to impress everyone...

Cheers and goodnight sciencly,
Coco
