someone in my lab group failed her candidacy exam for the second time, today. this is a presentation you give after 2 years of starting your phd to show that you have a good direction that you're working in -- an initial defense of your thesis, if you will.

at this point, because she's failed it a second time, she's kicked out of the program. she has until june to... pack her bags and leave.

cheers,
coco
