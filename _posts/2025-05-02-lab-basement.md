Hey friends! The time is 2258pm. I am in the lab basement working on my 24 hour take-home midterm. My life was looking extremely bleak when I ran out of gpt 4o, but then I realised that students ( I think only Canada and America) get 2 months free of gpt plus. If there's any time to use it, it's now.

I shall maybe email when I finish the midterm. Busy times. I can tell you all about it but who's not busy you know.

Cheers,
Coco
