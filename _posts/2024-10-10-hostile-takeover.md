Hello everyone,

Little does Coco know, but anyone can email this mailing list as long as they have the mailing address, so today I will be cutely and demurely taking over her mailing list and holding it hostage as I am bored.

Hi everyone. If you don't know me, my name is Stanford, and I became friends with Coco way back in her Canada era. She then proceeded to haul ass halfway across the globe to London to get away from, but now she has returned to the Western Hemisphere where I can harass her at a reasonable time for me. 

Anyway, I just wanted to pop in and say "hi" and to tell y'all to stay frosty.

Stanford, singing off for now...

Moist embraces,
Stanford <3
