it's been a big week. went to a party in a fancy apartment where people were doing laughing gas, and i stole a large bottle of tequila. went to rocco and ben's dorm and i'm pretty sure them and their friends really don't like each other. i am retaliating against emma mcnesby.

i am seeking refuge in the comfort of physics, and omri with whom i'm taking a class with. we get coffee together after class with his lab mates, i am now somewhat well acquainted with all of them.

with uchicago you have to pick and choose what you enjoy, choose your own adventure. there's always going to be people you don't get along with. personally i've done too much investigative journalism this week, and i've frankly got bigger fish to fry.

i sincerely hope you all have been dealing with more pleasant people this week.

cheers,
coco
