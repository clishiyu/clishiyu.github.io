Double feature

---------------------------

Sitting in the physics building lobby I was just on my laptop when someone approached me and asked me how was doing. 

He then proceeded to say "Have you ever dreamed about getting fucked by a black man?" (Maybe you've clued in by now that he is a black man.)
I said, "No," and he asked, 'Would you want to? I'll pay your tuition for two years."
I said, "Could you leave me alone, please?" He replied, "No," but then, in fact, he did walk away."

Not five minutes later the cops showed up and I watch this man get arrested. They asked me if I was ok.

---------------------------

I went to the pub last night, which actually gives negative dog shits about ID-ing people. It was a great time and I had 2 guinesses long live guinnesses. Saw my friend Maggie, who transferred here from UAL, get extremely drunk and started committing PDA, then proceeded to ask my friend Javi for his Instagram even though she was making out with someone else not more than 5 minutes before, and Javi is dating my good friend Ece. Man I Love Drinking!

An update on this...

Saw Maggie at the pub again last night, and turns out her drink was spiked that night. She woke up in the ER (A&E).
