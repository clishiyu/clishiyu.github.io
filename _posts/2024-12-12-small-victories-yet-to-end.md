I finished one final and one presentation. Final went ok which means it went well. Then presentation went well. One more final to go but I'm rapidly crashing.

Cut the inside of my lips a bit today because I was holding pieces of paper in my mouth.

Almost there! Not to exciting of an update I'm afraid.
