Hope you're all keeping well! It's been quiet on the Western front (the west coast?!). Not much is happening except that I went polar bear dipping yesterday and got poutine. I'm really dreading going back to Chicago and I'm only registered for two classes right now which I need to sort out ASAP as classes start in three days.

Polar bear dipping is a Canadian? Vancouverite? Tradition where people go swim in the ocean on January 1st . The water was 4 degrees.

Cheers,
Coco
