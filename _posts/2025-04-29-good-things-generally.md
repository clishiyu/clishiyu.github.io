Hello all! 

I have spent days working on this code and I kept running into small issues that led to crazy nonsensical answers but I believe I finally have a correct version! This is super exciting. 

Wednesday will be last day of pope sim, and Javi is leaving for Europe tomorrow. We had a leaving dinner today for which I made cream of mushroom soup and it was good!!! Omri and David showed up as well because they are now Javi oomfies from boardgames. David also knows about pope class.

It's the little things!

Cheers,
Coco
