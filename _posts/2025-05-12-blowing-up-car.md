this past weekend was scav, a uchicago tradition 4-day scavenger hunt. there's teams, there's prizes -- you get the idea. 

one of the things to check off was blowing up a car and so blow up a car uchicago students did. namely they bought a $50 dollar car off of fbmp (that still drove), shot a bunch of guns at it in a field in indiana.
