yesterday was interesting so i finally have content to share. we went to
- a vintage market
- watch a film as a part of the chicago film festival
- eat ramen
- a jazz bar

it was a really really fun day, and chicago is actually a beautiful city.

i cannot balance the stress of impending deadlines and doing fun things at the
same time. when i am doing a fun thing i think i really need to block out any
guilt that i am not doing work in that moment.

otherwise, it is also a really weird thing to carve out a place of your own as
an exchange student. expectations unclear, difficult waters to navigate.

i feel so tense.

for those who know omri, i saw him this morning and we had a very nice brief
chat!

sending lots of love and only the warmest regards to wherever you are!

cheers,
coco
