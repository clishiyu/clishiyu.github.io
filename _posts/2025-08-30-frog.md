I've been learning about this thing called FROG since like 1 year + ago. It's a measurement device for ultrafast pulses. I've learned about it at King's and read so much about it at UChicago. Yesterday I was finally able to successfully operate it in real life. I genuinely still don't understand how it works but it's super exciting nonetheless.
