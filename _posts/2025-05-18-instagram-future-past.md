I redownloaded instagram on Friday and what I experienced genuinely felt like a relapse. Instagram is so bad for me!!!!!! If you ever see me on Instagram I AM NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME and you should do EVERYthing in your power to get me to delete it!!! Although I will not listen to you!

This mailing list is facilitated through UChicago listhost service. I lose access to my UChicago email 45 days after the term ends. What's after? I want to keep sending out emails but what is the angle? I can start a Substack. But. I also cannot start a Substack. Something about this exact arrangement scratches my head right. 

It has been a fun past 2 days. On Friday went swimming in the lake, sailing, and swing dancing after. Then on Saturday I genuinely bedrotted for the entire day until I went to see Peggy. I saw a lot of friends and it was a special feeling. One more week of teaching, 12 more days in Chicago. 

Feeling transient! Liminal! Tense!

Cheers,
Coco
