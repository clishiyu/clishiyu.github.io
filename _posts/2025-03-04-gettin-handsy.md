just now on my way back from the logan centre i figured out how to ride a bike without my hands! nothing short of euphoric. i genuinely feel like the coolest cat on the block.

javi was in new orleans this weekend and got arrested. handcuffed even. he spent 7 hours at the police station and 3 of those in a cell. he's now in contact with two lawyers and has to go to new orleans again this week to dispute his charges. 

why he got arrested you might ask? public urination. his hands were put behind his back, and before he knew it he was inside the safe enclave of the police car. 

long live double features,

p.s. get a handle on things, on the one hand, pretty hands-off, etc etc etc.

javi’s student visa got cancelled and he most likely will need to end his exchange early. america is a harsh place.

finals week just ended and it’s been hell. not this bad though.
