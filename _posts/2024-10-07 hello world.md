hello friends!

i hate instagram and i love emails and i am bad at keeping up with people.

i think i made it so that all members of the list can also post, i have no
idea where you can do this. however i think replying to an email on the
listhost will send it to everyone else.

if you want to unsub i think you have to contact me because you don't have an
account on the uchicago mailing list website. i won't take offence though,
just let me know.

i will post low quality content only, and i will likely give this up within a
month.

cheers,
coco
