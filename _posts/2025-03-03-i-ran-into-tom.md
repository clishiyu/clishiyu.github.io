I ran into tom my oomfie from first quarter I actually haven't seen him since then. He is so smart and I am always so impressed by him. He finished his classes that he needs to graduate so instead this quarter he is just auditing a bunch of classes and reading up on algorithmic game theory. ok.

Cheers,
Coco
