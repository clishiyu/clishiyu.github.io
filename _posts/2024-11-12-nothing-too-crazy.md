Hey!

Just wanted to give a quick update --

I got my QM midterm score back. It was pretty brutal but I passed, just about. There is a thermal midterm next week so there is no Pset this week so that's one less thing to worry about! Otherwise, I have architecture readings to do, which I won't start until tomorrow, they're due tomorrow. I will also ask for an extension for my arch project. And thennnn I need to do my research tonight because I am really behind, and also another exchange student who is also in a lab says she's been going in 3 days a week from 9-5..... Soooooo I'm afraid I am not committing enough to the labs it seems.

Idk this is a really uninteresting update. I also finished all the mac and cheese I made yesterday lol. 

I have counselling tomorrow, which, thank god.

Sorry for being incoherent,
Coco
