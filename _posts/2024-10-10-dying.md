i'm working on the pset that's due tomorrow. i gaslit myself into thinking that it wouldn't be a big deal because i've done thermal before but lowkey they're just throwing completely random questions at us it's actually crazy.

i'm also working on it with real uchicago students and i'm not even working with them but i get so self-conscious by just existing in the same room as them

cheers
