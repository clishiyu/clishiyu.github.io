last night i cried to mailing list for someone to take over my flat and this morning one of the guys confirmed his interest and realized that we weren't getting through to him before because we had the wrong phone number.

tonight i shall rely on the  powers of the  mailing list again and ask for great assistance and fortune in my thesis. time is of the essence and i am sleepier by day. 

i hope the end to not be too painful and should i need to work late into the night then i hope i find myself passionate or at least making some progress.

cheers,
coco

i took a shower and gained a great amount of clarity. namely i have 25 days left - now that’s not a lot, but also is a significant amount of days. i cannot push myself continuously for 25 days without burning out.

i am going to new orleans may 2-4. i want all my work for the thesis done by then. afterwards i can spend may 4-19 writing my thesis and preparing my presentation. 

until may 2nd though, i cannot afford to fuck around and find out anymore. there needs to realistically be no days where i do no thesis.

if i get stuck i go to greg engel shamelessly. 

if you’re still here please tell me of your success stories of making the impossible possible, and/or general encouragements. although i understand that everyone is actually dying right now.

greg engel believes that this is possible. therefore it must be.
