chat i just had the most productive flight of my life i have no idea how i pulled that. one out of the bag

i knit
did my readings for architecture
did some sketches for architecture
started my lab assignment

all in the span of 4 hours. crazy what happens when i don't have internet. im going to heavily reform the way i use my phone and minimize scrolling. i will provide updates on this motive.

whenever i go on a flight i go into a trance. usually i can knit for hours on end. quite genuinely i think what's happening is that my brain produces sleep chemicals but i force myself to stay awake, and then something goofy happens clearly. i feel unstoppable, and bloated.
