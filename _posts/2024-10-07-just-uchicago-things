i have been in chicago since the 20th, so just over two weeks now. there been
ups and downs, with possibly more downs than ups?

uchicago is a weird place. here's some things of note:
1. i complimented a girl's outfit at the end of class in my thermal which is
the bummiest class ever. she ran away and did not try to start any sort of
conversation.
2. i got invited to dinner party at this master student's, but he says he
hosts these for a small fee. am i joining a pyramid scheme? i also just hate
how transactional that is??? this is the direct quote:
"I often host small dinner parties/social events/activities for a small fee,
so i can feed myself and carry on for life."
who do you think you are! is this a networking event?

otherwise i asked this random guy where the bathroom is and he had a british
accent. so i was like WHERE are you from!! turns out he did his ug at
newcastle, phd at sheffield, and now he is doing his postdoc here! he was
really impressed when i said i went to king's which i really dont think
warrants that kind of praise.

i haven't figured out how to add images to these emails yet. also idk if i can
swear in these emails since they're under uchi.

cheers,
coco
