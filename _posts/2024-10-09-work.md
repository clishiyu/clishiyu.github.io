it is so funny i get assigned work weekly which is genuinely not bad at all.
most people get assigned work after every class.

however, it still has come to the point where i am so stressed and i feel so
stupid and the usual cycle.

on a more positive note i've been invited to work on a pset with uchicago
students. one of them is in two of my classes and is the skrunkliest boy.

i hope i survive. this is week 1.

cheers,
coco
