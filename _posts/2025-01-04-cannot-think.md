Ive been dyeing my hair all day and now i am trying to do some very simple housekeeping tasks on the laptop and i genuinely cannot think straight because ive inhaled so much bleach fumes.

Hair pics soon but also i feel as though i am being pulled back to a life of productivity against my will in that i am slowly responding to stuff that i should've a long time ago and it feels so foreign and disgusting.

Sighhhhhhhh,
Coco
