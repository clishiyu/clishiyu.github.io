Hey all,

I would love to receive some physical mail --- letters, postcards. Is it too presumptuous of me to ask for it?

My address for the next three weeks is:

Shiyu Li
Max-Planck-Institut f�r Quantenoptik
Hans-Kopfermann-Stra�e 1
85748 Garching bei M�nchen
Deutschland

If you send me mail I will be the happiest camper. Mail usually takes 1-2 weeks so if you want my London address I can also give!!

Cheers,
Coco
