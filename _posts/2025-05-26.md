I stalk uchicagoans on the daily. Like my search history is almost purely "[name] + uchicago". The thing about being somewhat of an academic is that you will have a digital footprint. Lol. But then I found a friend/acquaintance's reddit which feels severely more personal. He frequents r/mathematics and r/drugs. Idk. I'm kinda obsessed.
