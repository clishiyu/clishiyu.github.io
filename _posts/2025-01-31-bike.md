guys yesterday i installed a rack on my bike and put new grip tape on and it looked so drippy and it was awesome. by some divine intervention i'm sure of it this morning my bike wheel is now bent and unusable.

it was a wheel they had to find for me as well i have to go back to the bike shop and see if they have a possible replacement. 

cheers,
coco

ps i'm in my engineering class and someone wrote down on their notes that need to review basic trig derivatives for the exam. this is an upper year engineering course.
