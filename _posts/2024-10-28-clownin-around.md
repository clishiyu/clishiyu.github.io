hello all!

find me in chicago once again, my personal hell.

today is the dreaded midterms. i tried studying for them in new york with very
little avail. furthermore, this morning, instead of spending my time studying
(studying on the same day as the exam is surely futile anyways), i have
dressed up as a clown so i will befittingly acing my clown exam from clown
university in clownfoolery!

cheers and happy halloween!

Hey clowns,

My midterm is handed in so I am free until tomorrow at lunch at which point I have my other midterm.

It was intense. It was a lot. But we're done and lowkey it might be better than I thought?

I hope your clown days are full of unseriousness and jestering!

Cheers,
Coco
