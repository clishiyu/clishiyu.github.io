Being in the library, I found out from Ece that Chat is down. Later, I heard people whisper "Chat is back up!" in pure delight in the quiet section of the library. Today I asked a math question to my architecture classmate who does maths, to which she responded she doesn't know the answer and why don't I just ask Chat.

Crazy! It's everywhere.
