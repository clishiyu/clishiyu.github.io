coco,

its me, nathan, i am here and i think i know what song and or album i would recommend. normally i would ask for you to solve riddles three, but you have caught me in a benevolent mood and thus will not proceed with my riddles.
i have watched your activity on airbuds, ethel cain preacher's daughter album would an addition you could make. you seem to like the cocktoe twins. those eyes that mouth. cico buff. 

yours truly,
nathan

coco,

have you by any chance heard of this song? I believe that everyone should give it a listen at least once in their life. it is truly revolutionary and has a catchy beat.
