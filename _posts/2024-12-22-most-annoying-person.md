i have so much shit from when i was younger. it's so much work to clean out the old stuff and overwhelming to confront just how much Stuff i've bought and accumulated over the years.

like i use 0% of any of this stuff on the daily and it would genuinely not make a difference if it all just disappeared. with that being said, some stuff i just cannot bring myself to throw away and also it just feels extremely wasteful. most of it is being brough to salvation army.

cheers and happy holidays,
coco
