i went to see tagabow, who opened for julie. i didn't know who julie was
before tonight but they're really good.

i get unfathomable amounts of social anxiety when i go to concerts.

the days are busy as always, i'm still learning to live with the stress and
not be so overwhelmed by it. it is a constant whirlwind

it is now 12:15 and i will try to write a draft of my abstract for my thesis
by tonight.

good night sleepy children! i miss you all dearly and i wish i could be
present for all plows that have been and all that will ever be driven.

p.s. i'm so sorry the mechanics of the mailing list are genuinely a mystery to
me that i've lowkey given up figuring it out, e.g. weird formatting on mobile
and people not being able to reply/only some people seeing reply, etc.
