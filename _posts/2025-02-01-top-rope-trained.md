hello!

One of my main goals for this quarter was to get top rope certified. I am happy to announce that yesterday I passed my top rope certification and had a really fun rope/belay sesh. @Lety Nada Declan was my guinea pig and had to put his life in my hands. 

Happy February! Things in store this month include visting monica in boston and taki coming to chicago. Furthermore I have to give a presentation on my research to my research group as well as submit a report in like... Two weeks... It's pretty fucked girls and boys. Dreading it severely and feeling extremely incompetent. I'm a bit paralyzed from just writing this out.

Why is it never possible to live a balanced life?

Cheers,
Coco
