i will have 1 or 2 radio shows at uchi! keep student radio alive

i have met with like 3 or 4 potential supervisors for my project now and todayi get to pick and choose. i get to reject some of them which actually is not avery pleasant thing to do. i will may do research in optical resonance imaging(MRI but optical), or semiconductor quantum optics stuff. physics buzzwords
