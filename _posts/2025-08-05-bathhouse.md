i was a little sore from climbing so i wanted to take a hot bath but i don't have a hot tub so i google maps-ed hot bath. ok.

instead i found this swimming pool built in the 1900s still maintained in perfect condition with sauna. 

it was scary because it's a super specific setup... changing rooms, where the pools are, how to swim... also the sauna + hot room + hot tub places are completely nude.

im really proud of myself for overcoming all my anxieties and properly using this facility. it was an amazing experience and it was beautiful. liberating. i also had to use the little german i know for this experience to ask where the pool is and say thanks when someone complimented my tattoo.

i also packed myself chocolate and a warm jumper and i forgot i packed these things for myself. i was so happy to find them in my bag.

bathed,
coco
