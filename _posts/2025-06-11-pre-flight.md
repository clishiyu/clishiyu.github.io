flight at 2200 been at airport since 1400.

got a notification at 1900 that the flight departed. holy shit balls. went to the gate and had a bunch of confused people. there was no flight that departed. thank god.

ok started chatting with british film studies phd student and then halfway through a quebecois montreal 18 year old doing 12 day trip in europe joined our conversation. 

we chat until boarding time and then they ask me do i have my e visa. do i have my e visa? fuck? do i? i sweat all over again but i do have e visa. ok

now i've christened the plane bathroom and im sat. c u soon.

cheers,
coco
