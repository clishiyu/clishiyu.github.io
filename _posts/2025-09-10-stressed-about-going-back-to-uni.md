Summer has been very chill and I'm afraid to go back to the grind. As always the brain does not like change either. Uni means more stakes means more room for Failure. Whether it was uchicago or king's I never seemed to have a free moment to myself, I don't think that is about to change when I start my Masters.

But also, the mind is capable of many amazing things and everything will be fine because of it. May the seasons change and the summer rain wash away any doubts and worries.
