my friends........

It is 11:05pm on a Friday and I have just submitted all my work. I (hopefully and naively) thought that I would be done at, say 4pm, and could've gone climbing afterwards. But, as all these past weeks have proven, that never happens, and if anything, I should take joy in the fact that I am not working any later. 

This means that I am free for now, although deadlines are already looming for after the break, and finals are a mere 2 or 3 weeks out. Alas, I take what I can get, and it seems that UChicago relentlessly takes from me all it can get.

In the end, I'm quite satisfied with my quantum pset. I'm going to go have my third indomie of the day, and then maybe start on knitting some legwarmers.

Bisous and ciao,
Coco
